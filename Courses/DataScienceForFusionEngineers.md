# Data Science for Fusion Engineers

## A 10-Week Practical Course for Customer Support Engineers

This course is designed for customer support engineers who need to understand data science fundamentals to effectively curate, evaluate, and deploy AI technology within a support organization. The curriculum follows an iterative, hands-on approach—each week builds on previous concepts while introducing new skills that can be immediately applied to real support scenarios.

## Course Philosophy

### Why "Fusion Engineers"?

Fusion Engineers represent a new breed of support professional who combines traditional customer support expertise with data science literacy. Rather than becoming full data scientists, Fusion Engineers develop enough fluency to:

- **Curate** training data and knowledge bases for AI systems
- **Evaluate** AI model performance using proper metrics
- **Collaborate** effectively with data science teams
- **Champion** AI adoption within support organizations
- **Identify** opportunities where AI can improve customer outcomes

### Iterative Learning Approach

Each week follows a consistent structure:

1. **Concept Introduction** — Core theory with support-relevant examples
2. **Hands-On Lab** — Practical exercises using real support data patterns
3. **AI Application** — How the concept applies to AI tools in support
4. **Assessment** — Knowledge check and practical application
5. **Bridge to Next Week** — Preview of upcoming concepts
