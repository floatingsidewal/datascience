# Bayesian Statistics & Probabilistic Modeling

Graduate programs in Bayesian Statistics focus on probabilistic reasoning, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian inference methods for complex modeling scenarios.

---

## What This Subdiscipline Studies

Bayesian Statistics provides a framework for updating beliefs based on evidence. Graduate programs cover:

- **Bayesian Fundamentals**: Prior and posterior distributions, conjugate families, Bayes' theorem
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling, convergence diagnostics
- **Hierarchical Models**: Multi-level modeling, random effects, partial pooling
- **Probabilistic Programming**: Stan, PyMC, JAGS, TensorFlow Probability
- **Bayesian Machine Learning**: Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, variational inference
- **Causal Inference**: Directed acyclic graphs, intervention, counterfactuals
- **Decision Theory**: Utility functions, optimal decisions under uncertainty

## Real-World Applications

### Clinical Trials
Bayesian adaptive designs allow trials to update based on accumulating evidence, potentially reaching conclusions faster with fewer patients.

### A/B Testing
Bayesian methods provide direct probability statements about which variant is better, enabling earlier decisions with proper uncertainty quantification.

### Reliability Engineering
Probabilistic models estimate failure rates, predict maintenance needs, and quantify uncertainty in system reliability.

### Ecology & Environmental Science
Hierarchical Bayesian models integrate data from multiple sources and scales, accounting for observation error and process variability.

### Sports Analytics
Bayesian methods estimate player abilities, predict game outcomes, and optimize strategies while properly accounting for uncertainty.
