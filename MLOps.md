## What This Subdiscipline Studies

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) bridges the gap between ML model development and production deployment. Graduate programs cover:

- **Model Deployment**: Containerization, model serving, API design, edge deployment
- **CI/CD for ML**: Automated testing, model validation, continuous training pipelines
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Data drift detection, model performance tracking, alerting
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, cloud platforms, distributed training, GPU management
- **Feature Engineering**: Feature stores, data versioning, reproducibility
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases, hyperparameter management
- **Model Governance**: Model registry, compliance, audit trails, versioning

## Real-World Applications

### Tech Companies
Large-scale recommendation systems, search engines, and ad ranking systems require robust MLOps to handle millions of predictions per second with high reliability.

### Financial Services
Trading systems and risk models require real-time deployment, strict versioning, audit compliance, and monitoring for model degradation.

### Healthcare
Medical AI systems need rigorous validation, regulatory compliance (FDA), and monitoring to ensure patient safety and efficacy.

### E-Commerce
Recommendation engines, pricing models, and fraud detection systems require continuous updating and monitoring across millions of transactions.

### Manufacturing
Predictive maintenance and quality control models must operate reliably at the edge with intermittent connectivity and resource constraints.
