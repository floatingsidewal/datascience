## Real-World Applications

### Social Media
Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok process billions of events daily. Data engineers build systems for user feeds, content recommendations, and analytics.

### Internet of Things (IoT)
Connected devices generate massive data streams. Data engineering enables smart cities, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring systems.

### Financial Services
Banks process millions of transactions requiring real-time fraud detection, regulatory reporting, and risk calculations across distributed systems.

### Genomics
Sequencing a single human genome generates ~200 GB of data. Data engineering enables large-scale genomic studies and precision medicine.

### E-Commerce
Recommendation engines, inventory systems, and customer analytics require processing terabytes of behavioral and transactional data.
