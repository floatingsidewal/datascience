## What This Subdiscipline Studies

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Combined with robotics, this field enables intelligent autonomous systems. Graduate programs cover:

- **RL Fundamentals**: Markov Decision Processes, value functions, policy optimization
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: DQN, Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic methods, PPO
- **Robot Perception**: Computer vision, sensor fusion, SLAM, localization
- **Motion Planning**: Path planning, trajectory optimization, collision avoidance
- **Control Systems**: Classical control, model predictive control, adaptive control
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Collaborative robotics, safety, intent prediction
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Simulation environments, domain randomization, transfer learning

## Real-World Applications

### Autonomous Vehicles
Self-driving cars use RL for decision-making in complex traffic scenarios, including lane changes, merging, and intersection navigation.

### Manufacturing Automation
Industrial robots perform assembly, welding, painting, and material handling. RL enables robots to adapt to variations and optimize processes.

### Healthcare Robotics
Surgical robots assist with precise procedures, rehabilitation robots help patients recover motor function, and care robots assist elderly individuals.

### Warehouse & Logistics
Companies like Amazon deploy thousands of mobile robots for inventory management, order picking, and package sorting.

### Space Exploration
Autonomous rovers and spacecraft use RL for navigation, scientific exploration, and resource management in remote environments.
