## Real-World Applications

### Clinical Decision Support
AI systems analyze patient data to suggest diagnoses, flag drug interactions, recommend treatments, and identify patients at risk for adverse events.

### Drug Discovery
Machine learning accelerates drug development by predicting molecular properties, identifying candidate compounds, and optimizing clinical trial design.

### Genomics & Precision Medicine
Analysis of genetic data enables personalized treatment plans, disease risk prediction, and pharmacogenomic prescribing.

### Hospital Operations
Analytics optimize staffing, bed management, supply chain, and revenue cycle. Predictive models forecast patient volumes and resource needs.

### Population Health
Public health agencies use data science for disease surveillance, outbreak detection, health equity analysis, and intervention evaluation.
