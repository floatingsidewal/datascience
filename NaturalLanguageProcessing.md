## What This Subdiscipline Studies

Natural Language Processing sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. Graduate-level NLP programs cover:

- **Computational Linguistics**: Formal models of language structure, syntax parsing, semantic analysis
- **Text Mining & Information Extraction**: Named entity recognition, relation extraction, knowledge graphs
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Opinion mining, emotion detection, stance classification
- **Machine Translation**: Neural machine translation, multilingual models, cross-lingual transfer
- **Conversational AI**: Dialogue systems, chatbots, question answering systems
- **Speech Processing**: Speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, voice assistants
- **Large Language Models**: Transformer architectures, pre-training methods, fine-tuning techniques

## Real-World Applications

### Healthcare
NLP powers clinical decision support systems by extracting information from electronic health records, medical literature mining, and automated medical coding. Systems can identify adverse drug events, assist with diagnosis, and summarize patient histories.

### Finance
Financial institutions use NLP for sentiment analysis of news and social media to inform trading decisions, automated contract analysis, fraud detection in communications, and regulatory compliance monitoring.

### Customer Service
Virtual assistants and chatbots handle customer inquiries, route support tickets, and provide 24/7 assistance. NLP enables intent classification, entity extraction, and context-aware responses.

### Legal
Law firms employ NLP for contract analysis, legal research, e-discovery, and document classification. Systems can identify relevant precedents and extract key clauses from thousands of documents.

### Media & Content
Content recommendation engines, automated summarization, plagiarism detection, and content moderation all rely on NLP techniques.
