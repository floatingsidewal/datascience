## What This Subdiscipline Studies

Statistical Machine Learning combines rigorous statistical theory with practical machine learning methods. Graduate programs cover:

- **Probability Theory**: Random variables, distributions, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem
- **Statistical Inference**: Point estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing
- **Regression Analysis**: Linear, logistic, polynomial, regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso)
- **Classification Methods**: Naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, support vector machines
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, LDA, t-SNE, manifold learning
- **Ensemble Methods**: Bagging, boosting, random forests, gradient boosting
- **Model Selection**: Cross-validation, information criteria, bias-variance tradeoff

## Real-World Applications

### Clinical Trials
Statistical methods power drug development, from study design through efficacy analysis. Machine learning identifies patient subgroups and predicts treatment responses.

### A/B Testing
Tech companies use statistical methods to evaluate product changes, from website layouts to algorithm updates. Proper experimental design ensures valid conclusions.

### Quality Control
Manufacturing uses statistical process control to monitor production quality. Machine learning detects anomalies and predicts failures.

### Genomics
Statistical models analyze genetic data to identify disease markers, understand inheritance patterns, and develop personalized treatments.

### Insurance
Actuarial science applies statistical methods to price policies, assess risks, and model claims. Machine learning improves fraud detection and customer segmentation.
