## What This Subdiscipline Studies

Quantitative Finance (also called Financial Engineering or Computational Finance) combines mathematics, statistics, and computer science for financial applications. Graduate programs cover:

- **Time Series Analysis**: ARIMA, GARCH, cointegration, state space models
- **Derivatives Pricing**: Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulation, binomial trees
- **Risk Management**: VaR, CVaR, stress testing, credit risk modeling
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Mean-variance optimization, factor models, risk parity
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Market microstructure, execution algorithms, high-frequency trading
- **Machine Learning in Finance**: Sentiment analysis, alternative data, deep learning for forecasting
- **Stochastic Calculus**: Brownian motion, Itô calculus, martingales

## Real-World Applications

### Algorithmic Trading
Quantitative traders develop automated strategies that execute trades based on mathematical models, statistical patterns, and market signals.

### Risk Management
Banks and financial institutions use quantitative models to measure and manage market risk, credit risk, and operational risk.

### Asset Management
Quantitative portfolio managers use mathematical models to construct portfolios, optimize allocations, and manage risk across asset classes.

### Insurance
Actuaries use statistical models for pricing, reserving, and risk assessment. Machine learning improves fraud detection and claims prediction.

### Fintech
Startups apply quantitative methods to lending decisions, robo-advisory, payment optimization, and blockchain applications.
