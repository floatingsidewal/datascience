## Real-World Applications

### Autonomous Vehicles
Self-driving cars rely on computer vision for lane detection, pedestrian recognition, traffic sign reading, and obstacle avoidance. Multiple camera systems provide 360-degree awareness.

### Medical Diagnostics
AI systems analyze X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and pathology slides to detect cancers, fractures, and other conditions. Computer vision assists radiologists and can flag urgent cases for priority review.

### Manufacturing & Quality Control
Automated inspection systems detect defects in products, verify assembly completeness, and ensure quality standards. Vision-guided robots handle precise manipulation tasks.

### Retail & E-Commerce
Visual search allows customers to find products by uploading images. Checkout-free stores use computer vision to track what shoppers pick up. Inventory management systems monitor shelf stock levels.

### Security & Surveillance
Facial recognition, anomaly detection, crowd monitoring, and access control systems all leverage computer vision technologies.
